      Minecraft is a video game in which players create and break apart various kinds of blocks in three-dimensional
      worlds.
      The game’s two main modes are Survival and Creative. In Survival, players must find their own building supplies
      and
      food. They also interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures. (Creepers and zombies are some of the dangerous
      ones.) In Creative, players are given supplies and do not have to eat to survive. They also can break all kinds of
      blocks immediately. Minecraft is a video game in which players create and break apart various kinds of blocks in
